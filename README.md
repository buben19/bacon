### Features

My idea is create fancy, advanced and professional looking 3D printer. There are
many features builded in printer design.

    Complete laser cuttable from 6 mm thick material (except extruder and pulleys)
    Build-in Raspberry Pi print server
    Three point headbed mount for better calibration
    Cable chains at all moving parts
    No components placed out of printer (i.e. power supply)
    Supports wide range of extruders
    Filanment guide for mounting dust remover
    200 x 200 x 200 mm print volume (may be greater, depends on configuration)
    Designed for RAMPS 1.4 electronics
    Active electronics cooling
	Front panel with LCD display

### Note
   
This printer is in beta version and currently there is no real build. Some parts
still may change during a time. I would be very happy for your feedback and any
impovement sugestions.
