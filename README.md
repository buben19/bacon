### Why you should care

My idea is create fancy and advanced 3D printer. There are many printer
improvements builded in printer design.

Printer features are:

    Complete laser cuttable from 6 mm thick material (except extruder and pulleys)
    Build-in Raspberry Pi print server
    Three point headbed mount for better calibration
    X-axis balancing with metal ropes
    Cable chains at all moving parts
    No components placed out of printer (i.e. power supply)
    Supports wide range of extruders
